# Science and Engineering Terms


 - Abstraction Layer: A generalization of a conceptual model.

 - Low-Level: A verb used to describe something that is relatively close to pure physics.

 - High-Level A verb used to describe something that is relatively further away from pure physics.



# Mathematics (the Abstract Representation of Nature)


 - Binary: A base 2 number system.

 - Hexadecimal: A base 16 number system.



# Hardware (Circuits, Electrical Components)


 - CPU (Central Processing Unit): A piece of hardware that can execute a program.

 - RAM (Random Access Memory) The hardware in a computer where programs and data currently in use are stored, and kept quickly accessible by the device's processor(s).



# Low-level programming (Machine code, Assembly Language)


 - Machine code: The lowest-level representation of a compiled or assembled computer program.

 - Assembly language: A programming language that is intended to communicate directly with a computer's hardware, can be compiled into machine code using an assembler.

 - Program: A sequence of instructions written so that a computer can perform a certain task.

 - Operating system: A program that manages computer hardware, and recources (ram/cpu power) as well as providing common services for writing programs.

 - Compiler: A program that translates a source program written in some high-level(C++, Java) programming language into machine code. 

  - Linker: A program that takes one or more object files generated by a compiler and combines them into one, executable program.



# High-level programming (C, C++, Pascal)


 - Data Type: A classification of data. A data type tells the compiler or interpreter how the data shall be handled.

 - Variable: A nick-name of a memory location.

 - Function: A group of statements that together perform a task.

 - Entry Point: An entry point is a point in a program where the execution of a the begins, and where the program has access to command line arguments.


# Scripting (Python, Lua)


 - Interpreter: A program that can analyse and execute a program/script line by line.

 - Scripting language: A type of programming language in which we can write code to control another software application.

 - Script: Code written in a scripting language.



# User Space (Windows, Desktop, Google Chrome)


 - Application: Applications are programs designed for end users.
