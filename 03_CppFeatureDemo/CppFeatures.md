# Data types


## Primary Data Types

 - Integer:A number which is not a fraction.

    - int8_t: -128 - 128
    - int16_t -32768 - 32768
    - int32_t (int):-2147483648 - 2147483648
    - int64_t -9223372036854775808 - 9223372036854775808
    - uint8_t: 0-256
    - uint16_t: 0-65536
    - uint32_t: 0-4294967296
    - uint64_t: 0-18446744073709551616

    - Character: A singular character
        - char: Same as uint8_t, interpreted differently by some functions. 
    - Boolean:
        - bool: Same as uint8_t, interpreted differently by some functions.
    - Floating point: Fractions.
        - float: 4 bytes, accuracy 7 decimal digit
        - double: 8 bytes, accuracy 16 decimal digit
    - Valueless:
        - Void
    - String: just some text baby baby
        - std::string: literally just text homie


## Abstract data types: user-defined (Stuff that we help define in our code)

 - List:
     - vector: Dynamic list, meaning that the number of elements are not statically defined.
 - Structure: Data structure
     - struct
 - Class: Data structure but more features
     - class

## Derived Data Types

# Conditionals
# if, else if and else

# Loops
 - Loop over a list
    - For
 - Repeat until condition returns false
    - While 

# Paradigms
